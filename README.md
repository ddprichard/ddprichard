- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dan Prichard. Currently I'm an Azure DevOps Administrator.
- I've worked with TFS since 2010 and I've moved from being a developer to working with organizations upgrading their ADO systems, customizing their ADO work items, and I do a ton of training (typically with teams new to the tool and often new to Agile).
